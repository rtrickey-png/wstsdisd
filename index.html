                <h1>An audiovisual virtual reality experience</h1>
                <p>To comemorate my completion of a Study Abroad Program
                  in Barcelona, Spain during the Summer 2022, I've created a virtual
                  space using <a href="https://aframe.io/">A-frame</a> and filled it with
                  originally composed poetry, film, and audio from my trip. I had
                  a lot of help in this process; I thank the following entities and collaborators
                  for making this project possible:</p>
                  <ul>
                      <li><a href="https://www.gilmanscholarship.org/">
                      The Gilman Scholarship Program</a>, which awards scholarships to
                      students seeking to study abroad on both merit and needs-based criteria.</li>
                      <li><a href="https://studyabroad.ucsd.edu/">The UC San Diego Study Abroad Office</a>,

                      <li>Gabriel Zalles-ballivian for acting as a mentor throughout this process
                      and helping me make this project real.</li>
                      <li>Brianda Mena for translating my original poem in English to Spanish</li>
                  </ul>
                <h2>Significance</h2>
                <p>
                  While abroad, many of my insecurities regarding communicating in Spanish
                  surfaced. I made a conscious effort every day to swallow my fear and
                  take any opportunity that arose to speak, listen, read, or write in
                  the language I have been studing on-and-off for 6 years.
                  Through all this, I've learned it all came down to a decision I had the
                  power to make in a moment. Would I listen to the voice in my head that wants
                  me to stay small and afraid? Or, would I risk it for the biscuit and try
                  out my language skills?
                </p>
                <p>
                  I learned that all it really boils down to is a decision, made in a
                  single moment of presence. I mimic this choice in the virtual space,
                  by giving you the choice between two versions of the short film: Spanish or English.
                </p>
                <!-- <h2>The haiku film...</h2> -->
                <p>
                  I composed the film from shots I recorded on my cell phone and edited
                  together in Premiere Pro. This was my final project for a course I took
                  at <a href="https://www.upf.edu/university">Universitat Pompeu Fabra (UPF)</a>.
                  It's a compilation of moments and scenes from my travels in Barcelona
                  and nearby parts of Spain.
                </p>
                <!-- <h2>The poem...</h2> -->
                <p>
                  The poem, which I wrote over the edited sequence of video,
                  captures a lot of my inner workings and insecurities.
                  I originally compsed this poem in English, and with help
                  from Brianda, translated the poem to Spanish.
                </p>
                <!-- <h2>The ambient audio...</h2> -->
                <p>
                  Lastly, the ambient audio heard in the virtual world is composed using a
                  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_Data">Pure Data</a>
                  patch and a field recording from a restaurant I ate at
                  while abroad. The Pure Data patch, adapted from
                  <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262014410/designing-sound/">Andy Farnell's
                    <em>Designing Sound</em></a>, synthesizes noise to mimic the sound of
                    wind blowing through trees.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  I chose to combine these two sounds in the virtual space because while
                  I was studying in Spain, the two things I found myself doing most often
                  were listening to the world around me as I walked, and dining with friends.
                  The sound of the cityscape, in particular the noise of leaves blowing in the breeze,
                  has a profoundly calming effect on me when I tune into it. These moments of peace
                  counteracted the mental gymnastics that ordering at a restaurant could sometimes be,
                  as I would challenge myself to order and speak with the waiter or waitress in Spanish.
                  Thus, I felt mashing the sound of tree leaves with a recording from a busy restaurant
                  in the virtual world best captured this dual nature of my experience abroad.
