| fftSize               | Frequency domain.                                                    | 2048          |
| smoothingTimeConstant | How smooth the frequency data is returned.                           | 0.8           |
| unique                | Whether to share the audio instance with other visualizing entities. | false         |

To access the analyser node:

```
el.components['audio-visualizer'].analyser;
```

#### audio-visualizer-kick

Adds kick with `audio-visualizer` component as a dependency.

Kicks are detected when the amplitude (normalized values between 0 and 1) of a
specified frequency, or the max amplitude over a range, is greater than the
minimum threshold, as well as greater than the previously registered kick's
amplitude, which is decreased by the decay rate per frame.

| Property  | Description                                                                    | Default Value |
| --------  | -----------                                                                    | ------------- |
| frequency | Range of frequencies of spectrum to check.                                     | 127, 129      |
| threshold | Threshold of amplitude to go over to fire a kick.                              | 0.00001       |
| decay     | Rate that previously registered kick's amplitude is reduced by on every frame. | 0             |

Events will be emitted on kicks and off kicks.

| Event Name                  | Description                                   |
| --------                    | -----------                                   |
| audio-visualizer-kick-start | Kick start. Went from not kicking to kicking. |
| audio-visualizer-kick-end   | Kick end. Went from kicking to not kicking.   |
