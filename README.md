# Who Set the Sun Down in San Diego?
An Interactive WebVR Experience

Through original poetry, song, and interactive design, the project calls attention to the wisdom of places and how recognizing beauty in the external world allows us to find it within.

This project combines the creative and technical skills I've acquired through studying Interdisciplinary Computing and the Arts (ICAM) and Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD).
